Hello! My name is Jennifer,  welcome to my  data science  sanctuary.

I'm  a  software engineer,  seeker,  observer  and  experimentalist. 
I love  machine learning, ai, systems,   pattern detection, portrait 
drawing, singing, and general research. I post projects, discoveries, 
and my meandering thoughts to this site, please enjoy!

### Updates

This website is a work in progress. It was built using Jekyll hosted 
on Git Pages, and has been a fun place for me to play around...   if 
things don't render,  it's  probably  because  I'm  enjoying  myself
behind the scene - I apologize for any inconvenience.
