Hello! My name is Jennifer, welcome to my data science sanctuary. I'm a computer engineer with a recent facination in data science, "prediction," Machine Learning and AI. I also love drawing, singing, and research in general. I post projects, inquiries, and my meandering thoughts to this site, please enjoy!
