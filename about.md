Hello! My name is Jennifer, welcome to my data science sanctuary. 

I'm a computer engineer, seeker, observer and experimentalist. 
I love Machine Learning, AI, systems, pattern detection, drawing, 
singing, and general research. I post projects, discoveries, 
and my meandering thoughts to this site, please enjoy!
